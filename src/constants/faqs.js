        content: "According to the Bureau of IS 4926:2003, Ready Mixed Concrete (RMC) is defined as concrete that is mixed in a stationary mixer at a central batching and/or mixing plant or in a truck mixer. It is delivered in a fresh state to the customer at the site, ready for immediate use. RMC is a pre-mixed product designed to meet specific requirements and is produced systematically. It is transported to project sites while ensuring the concrete maintains its desired fresh properties.",
